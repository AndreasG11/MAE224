# MATLAB Basics
Data processing with Matlab is quite straightforward. You can find the installation directions from Princeton OIT [here](https://www.princeton.edu/software/licenses/software/matlab/). Allocate anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours to complete the installation depending on your network connection, computer speed and technical prowess. For those of you running a flavor of Linux will have a bit more difficulty than your peers, and will experience some known bugs. These will not prohibit you from using Matlab, but they will make your life more interesting (e.g. problems w/ horizontal scrolling).  

Once everything is installed and all of the licenses have cleared, you can load Matlab and it will look something like this.

* _Current Folder_ - This displays the current working directory and the files/folders contained within. You can utilize and interact directly with *files* in the current working directory but not the folders. If you want to use a file located in an embedded folder you need to add it to the path or change the working directory to the child directory. You can tell if the folder is added to your path because it will be a normal text color, while directories not added will be transparent.
