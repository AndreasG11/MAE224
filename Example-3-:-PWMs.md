In this lab course you will be dealing with both analog and digital signals, it is important that you know the distinction between the two. **Signals** in general are a time varying quantities which give us some sort of information. Electronic signals can come in the form of current or voltage values (the two are related via Ohms law: V = IR, for some resistance, R). 

The Particle Photons can read in analog and digital voltages which will be our primary measurements in the lab.
