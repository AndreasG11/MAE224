Lab 1 is broken down into two parts:
- The first part will introduce you to the lab equipment used throughout this semester and teach you some of the basic measurement methods and debugging concepts used for any experiment (covered in this manual)
- In the second part of the lab you will be performing an experiment on fluid hydrostatics (covered _INSERT_LINK_)

## Introduction

This course begins by quickly leading you through the basics of the equipment used in the lab and the basics of some simple measurements. You are expected to be familiar with the concepts of voltage, current, resistance, and Ohm's law; although these will be reviewed briefly in this guide.

At certain points in the lab your lab group will be required to demonstrate the successful completion of an activity to either the TA or Mike. **These points will be indicated in boldface type** and must be completed before moving on to the next section of the lab manual
