The objective of this lab is to investigate laminar and turbulent flow, and the difference between them, in a pipe by creating a Moody diagram.   
In this experiment you will have to relate the pressure drop in the pipe to the Reynolds number.  
#Control the Experiment with Particle Photon  
In this experiment you will use a flow meter, electric pump and an optional pressure transducer. With your python, Particle Photon programming, and circuitry knowledge combined you can control and measure all of these things from the comfort of your own computer (with a little help from your Particle Photon friend). 
You will need to control the pump to a known flow rate and then record the pressure drop in the pipe. 
The Particle Photon cannot output the correct voltage or current needed to drive the pump, but it can output a PWM (pulse width modulation) signal! Therefore we will be using a transistor setup known as a MOSFET which will allow you to use an external power source to power the motor, but utilize the Particle Photon to control the motor output.  For those of you who like analogies, using a transistor is like controlling the flow of a firehose with a squirt gun.  The Particle Photon outputs a small square wave which tells the transistor to let a large amount of current flow through the motor.  The real working is a bit more complicated than that and involve quite a bit more applied physics knowledge, band gap theory, and understanding of NPN and PNP transistors, all of which Mike knows a lot about if you are interested in learning more. You can also look at this handy resource [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET) or if you are brave [Caltech APh9](http://nanofab.caltech.edu/images/stories/classes/aph9/lecture11.pdf).  All you need to know is that we can now control the motor with a Particle Photon.  Below is a diagram for wiring up the motor control.  

The MOSFET component is the Darlington pair transistor.  It has a gate (g), drain (d) and source (s) are in almost alphabetical order when looking at this component.  The base will be taking the analog output signal from your Particle Photon and will be what controls the output to the motor. The external 12V+ power will come into the motor, then out of it into the collector.  Across the power leads to and from the motor, there is a diode to prevent any back EMF from damaging the motor. The emitter will receive the black wire from the external power supply, which should be referenced to ground.
