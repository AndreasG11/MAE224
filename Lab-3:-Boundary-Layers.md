Today, we explore the velocity profile of a shear layer in a channel flow. You will do this by measuring the velocity along the cross section of the channel using a pitot tube. Pitot tubes can be used, with the help of Bernoulli’s equation, to measure the velocity at a point in the flow.  Actuators connected to the pitot tubes allow the pitot tubes to be moved up and down with commands from the Photon. You will again be using pressure transducers to measure pressure differences. 

The objective is to plot the boundary layer thickness as a function of wind tunnel speed for a few different wind tunnel speeds.

To do this, you will first obtain plots of velocity vs. distance from the wall in the channel. The boundary layer should be clearly visible!

##Concepts  
You are already familiar with measuring pressure in a flow. We often talk about three types of pressures in a flow:   

1.	Static pressure, ps: This is the pressure at an undisturbed point in the flow. In lab 2, you used pressure taps to find the static pressure drop along a pipe.  
2.	Total pressure, pt: the pressure at a point where the fluid has been brought to rest.    
3.	Dynamic pressure: this is the difference between the total and the static pressure and is related to the velocity of the fluid.

**Be sure you understand why we can apply Bernoulli’s equation in our channel flow. **  

Since we can apply Bernoulli’s equation in the flow, let’s think about the two points where we want to apply the equation:

This brings us back to the word small. The opening in the pitot tube is so small that air doesn’t enter it, which means that the flow sees the pitot tube as a bluff body (the zoomed-in figure). 

Using Bernoulli’s equation, and thinking about the boundary conditions at point 2 on the pitot probe: derive an expression for P2-P1  in the channel flow.
