## MAE 224 Fluids Lab: Spring 2017 To-Do List

- Mike is in charge of **_BOLD_** tasks

- Mark will cover

    * Updates to Lab manuals

    * Smoothing out conversion from pithy to Matlab

    * Testing all changes on each lab

## Lab Schedule

### Lab 1, Week 1: Introduction to lab equipment and experimental methods

- Photon: initial setup and output/read signals

    * Analog read/write: Example 1

- Oscilloscope: observe Photon signals and compare

- DMM: Use multimeter to read mean and RMS of signals

- Difference between analog and digital signals

    * PWM: Example 2

- Matlab Introduction

- Manual written for lab 1, part 1

## Lab 1, Week 2: Hydrostatics

- Add oscilloscope step for manual measurement/debug of transducer signal

- Update manual for use with Matlab (same goes for all labs)

- Correct calibration curves for all pressure transducers

## Lab 2: Pipe Flow

- Streamline/update lab manual

- Flowmeters/counters are robust and interface easily

- Add step for oscilloscope reading of flow meters

- Check motor controller circuit

- **_Terminal Block for all circuit connections (motor, flowmeters, etc)_**

## Lab3: Boundary Layers

- Pick final pressure transducers and order them pronto!

- Add a pre-test with TA/Mike approval before going into wind tunnel

- Update lab manual accordingly

## Lab 4: Airfoil and Cylinder

- Check range of airfoil tunnel Pitot transducer, might be to low at 0.1PSID

- **_Add pressure transducer to cylinder and multiplex new inputs_**

- Determine range of new pressure transducers pronto!

## Lab 5: Wind Turbine

- Repair/upgrade 3-D Printers pronto!

- **_Adjust range and calibrate Torque sensor_**

- Clean up measurement station

- Update manual

## What Mike has covered during Introduction to Thermodynamics Lab

- Voltage divider to read resistor

- Positive temp. coefficient demonstration with thermocouple

- Potentiometer

- Oscilloscope measurements of frequency and PWM is in one of the lab manuals
