## MAE 224 Fluids Lab: Spring 2017 To-Do List

- Mike is in charge of **_BOLD_** tasks

- Mark will cover

    * Updates to Lab manuals

    * Smoothing out conversion from pithy to Matlab

    * Testing all changes on each lab

    * ~~Unclaim and update all Particle Photons~~

- COMPLETED tasks are shown with ~~strikethrough~~

## Lab Schedule

### Lab 1, Week 1: Introduction to lab equipment and experimental methods

- ~~Photon: initial setup and output/read signals~~

    * ~~Analog read/write: Example 1~~

- ~~Oscilloscope: observe Photon signals and compare~~

- ~~DMM: Use multimeter to read mean and RMS of signals~~

- ~~Difference between analog and digital signals~~

- ~~Manual written for lab 1, part 1~~

## Lab 1, Week 2: Hydrostatics

- ~~Add oscilloscope step for manual measurement/debug of transducer signal~~

- ~~Update manual for use with Matlab (same goes for all labs)~~
- ~~Add Matlab code for data writing~~
- ~~ Upload calibration curves for all pressure transducers and link in lab manual.~~
- Functions in Matlab class file for reading pressure transducers, output is in Pascals (specific to each transducer _I dont really like this idea_).

## Lab 2: Pipe Flow

- ~~Streamline/update lab manual~~

- ~~Flowmeters/counters are robust and interface easily~~

- Add step for oscilloscope reading of flow meters

- ~~Check motor controller circuit~~

- Add picture with labels of the Motor Driver PCB to Lab Manual

- ~~Matlab/Photon `getTone()` function is acting weird, investigate!~~

- ~~Terminal Block for all circuit connections (motor, flowmeters, etc)~~

## Lab3: Boundary Layers

- ~~Do we have enough pressure transducers of the right range?~~ Yes I think so, we are using 10milliBar ones.
    o According to old lab reports the BL tunnel goes up to about 15-16 m/s. So using a U=20m/s gives a max dynamic pressure of 240 Pa or 2.4 mBar. We have (7) 1kPa transducers that should do the trick (HSCXXX010MD), should order a couple more just to be safe.
 
- ~~Add a pre-test with TA/Mike approval before going into wind tunnel~~

- ~~Update lab manual accordingly~~

## Lab 4: Airfoil and Cylinder

- ~~Check range of airfoil tunnel Pitot transducer, might be to low at 0.1PSID~~

- ~~Add pressure transducer to cylinder and multiplex new inputs~~

- ~~Determine range of new pressure transducers pronto!~~

- ~~Photon code for measuring pressures/AoA~~

- Matlab code to output surface normal positions needed!

## Lab 5: Wind Turbine

- ~~Repair/upgrade 3-D Printers pronto!~~

- **_Adjust range and calibrate Torque sensor_**

- ~~Add a sweet .gif to the lab manual~~

- Clean up measurement station

- ~~Update manual~~

## What Mike has covered during Introduction to Thermodynamics Lab

- Voltage divider to read resistor

- Positive temp. coefficient demonstration with thermocouple

- Potentiometer

- Oscilloscope measurements of frequency and PWM is in one of the lab manuals
