# Objective:
Design a turbine that can extract energy from the wind in a wind tunnel, following the Rules & Guidelines below.   

The remaining 4 weeks of labs are dedicated to the design and construction of the turbine. There will be a competition day sometime during the Reading Period, where all the lab groups will test their wind energy extractors.   

Like last semester, the “best” designs will get a treat: treat and definition of best TBD. 
# Rules & Guidelines  

-	Wind tunnel cross section: 2ft by 3ft  
-	Wind tunnel velocity: 20 m/s  
-	6 mm diameter on motor shaft (must use given start files for hub)  
-	Maximum swept turbine diameter is 15 cm.    
-	Limit on print time: < 8 hr  
-	The 3D printers we are using can be found in the fluids lab  
-	Must choose one of the 4 Cura print defaults  
-	The rotation vector must be aligned with the tunnel velocity. (i.e. turning clockwise when looking down the tunnel)  
-	*Note:* The RPM output that you will measure is the RPM of the motor. 1 RPM of the motor is equal to 3/4 RPM of the turbine. Do not forget to convert from the RPM of the motor to the RPM of the turbine when performing your calculations!

# Tools:
-	Each turbine must attach to the shaft in the wind tunnel   
-	Model your turbine in QBlade  
-	Design your turbine in CAD (CREO or Solidworks)  
-	To 3D print a part, you must generate the STL file and we (the TA's) will print the piece for you using the printers in the lab   

## Week 1: April 15 - 19  
Your objective this week is to experiment with the preprinted turbines and get an idea of what features you would like to see on your turbine. You will need to learn how to use the setup to construct your power curves. You have also been provided with CREO & QBlade tutorials, as well as some starter files for you to use. Ideally, you will have a first attempt at a turbine ready to print. **By the end of your lab period, you will need to submit your STL file to your TA for printing so you can have them next week at the latest**.
## Week 2: April 22 - 26  
Continue designing and experimenting with the turbine setup. Investigate the power generation of the blades you printed the week before, and figure out how to improve your design for next week. Submit another blade by the end of class.
## Week 3: April 29 - May 3   
Characterize your turbines and construct your power curves. This is your last lab period to test your design. You can either settle on using the current blades, or submit one final design (that will need to be tested on your own time).

**Deliverables due May 14th:** There are two components to the final lab report: an 8 page group report and a 2 page individual abstract and discussion.

# Final Report Guidelines
Final Report **due by 5pm on Dean's Date (May 14th, 2017)**, both group and individual.

## 8 Page Group Report
You and your lab partners will collaborate on the 8 page group report and hand in one single .pdf document (via email to the lab email address). Maximum length is 8 pages for the group section. It should include the following:

### Introduction
- Discuss scientific concept of the final project.
- Effectivelly present the objectives and purpose of the final project.

### Experimental Setup
- Give some detail on the measurements you made.

### Design Process
- Images and specifications (don't go overboard with the dimensions you give us).
- Calculation of the swept area--measured using CAD, a camera, or otherwise
- Why you chose this particular design.
- Explain the fluid mechanics of your design.
- What changed and why between your two rotor designs?

### Results
- Cp vs. TSR plots for all turbines.
- Qblade prediction of performance.

## 3 Page Individual Report
Each lab member is required to write a 3 page maximum report, also turned in to the lab email address as a .pdf document. The report should contain the following:

### Abstract
- Summarize your take on the turbine design process, this should cover the entire lab (group report sections and individual sections).

### Discussion
- Analyze the testing results.
- Compare with your predictions. Did they match? If they were different, why?
- How can the turbine design be improved?

### Conclusions
- Summarize the findings of the final project (don't just state what you did).
