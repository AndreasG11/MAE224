# Objective:
Design a turbine that can extract energy from the wind in a wind tunnel, following the Rules & Guidelines below.   

The remaining 4 weeks of labs are dedicated to the design and construction of the turbine. There will be a competition day sometime during the Reading Period, where all the lab groups will test their wind energy extractors.   

Like last semester, the “best” designs will get a treat: treat and definition of best TBD. 
# Rules & Guidelines  

-	Wind tunnel cross section: 2ft by 3ft  
-	Wind tunnel velocity: 15 m/s (you may test up to 25 m/s but the final competition will be at 15 m/s).  
-	6 mm diameter on motor shaft (must use given start files for hub)  
-	Limit on swept area: 177 cm^2 (equivalent to a 15 cm diameter circle).    
-	Limit on print time: < 8 hr  
-	The 3D printers we are using can be found here   
-	Must choose one of the 4 Cura print defaults  
-	The rotation vector must be aligned with the tunnel velocity. (i.e. turning clockwise when looking down the tunnel)  
-	*Note:* The RPM output that you will measure is the RPM of the motor. 1 RPM of the motor is equal to 3/4 RPM of the turbine. Do not forget to convert from the RPM of the motor to the RPM of the turbine when performing your calculations!

# Tools:
-	Each turbine must attach to the shaft in the wind tunnel   
-	Model your turbine in QBlade  
-	Design your turbine in CAD (CREO or Solidworks)  
-	To 3D print a part, you must generate the STL file and we (the TA's) will print the piece for you using the printers in the lab   

## Week 1: April 10-14  
Your objective this week is to experiment with the preprinted turbines and get an idea of what features you would like to see on your turbine. You will need to learn how to use the setup to construct your power curves. You have also been provided with CREO & QBlade tutorials, as well as some starter files for you to use. 
## Week 2: April 17-21  
Continue designing and experimenting with the turbine setup. **By the end of your lab period, you will need to submit your STL file to your TA for printing so you can have them next week at the latest**.  We will try to have them to you in a few days. Due to the large number of airfoils and small number of TA's and printers, if you turn your profile in late, you will be bumped to the end of the queue. It will still be printed, but only after the punctual groups and you will have significantly less time to characterize your turbine.
## Week 3: April 24-28  
Continue designing and testing your new baby turbine. **Your second design is due by 10AM the day after your designated lab section**. Again, due to the large number of airfoils and small number of TA's and printers, if you turn your profile in late, you will be bumped to the end of the queue. It will still be printed, but only after the punctual groups and you will have significantly less time to characterize your turbine.
## Week 4: May 1-5  
Characterize your turbines and construct your power curves.  
**Deliverables due May 16th:** There are two components to the final lab report: an 8 page group report and a 2 page individual abstract and discussion.

# Final Report Guidelines
Final Report **due by 5pm on Deans Date (May 16th, 2017)**, both group and individual.

## 8 Page Group Report
You and your lab partners will collaborate on the 8 page group report and hand in one single .pdf document (via email to the lab email address). Maximum length is 8 pages for the group section. It should include the following:

### Introduction
- Discuss scientific concept of the final project.
- Effectivelly present the objectives and purpose of the final project.

### Experimental Setup
- Give some detail on the measurements you made.

### Design Process
- Images and specifications (don't go overboard with the dimensions you give us).
- Calculation of the projected area--measured using CAD, a DSLR camera, or otherwise
- Why you chose this particular design.
- Explain the fluid mechanics of your design.
- What changed and why between your two rotor designs?

### Results
- Cp vs. TSR plots for all turbines.
- Qblade prediction of performance.

## 2 Page Individual Report
Each lab member is required to write a 2 page maximum report, also turned in to the lab email address as a .pdf document. The report should contain the following:

### Abstract
- Summarize your take on the turbine design process, this should cover the entire lab (group report sections and individual sections).

### Discussion
- Explain the fluid mechanics and the motivation behind the design.
- Analyze the testing results.
- Compare with your predictions. Did they match? If they were different, why?
- How can the turbine design be improved?

### Conclusions
- Summarize the findings of the final project (don't just state what you did).
