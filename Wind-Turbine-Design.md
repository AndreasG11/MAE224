# Objective:
Design a turbine that can extract energy from the wind in a wind tunnel, following the Rules & Guidelines below.   

The remaining 3 weeks of labs are dedicated to the design and construction of the turbine. There will be a competition day on May 9, where all the lab groups will test their wind energy extractors.   

Like last semester, the “best” designs will get a treat: treat and definition of best TBD. 
# Rules & Guidelines  

-	Wind tunnel cross section: 2ft by 3ft  
-	Wind tunnel velocity: 15 m/s (you may test up to 25 m/s but the final competition will be at 15 m/s).  
-	6mm diameter on motor shaft (must use start files for hub)  
-	Limit on swept area: 177 cm^2 (equivalent to a 15 cm diameter circle).    
-	Limit on print time: < 8 hr  
-	The 3D printers we are using can be found here   
-	Must choose one of the 4 Cura print defaults  
-	The rotation vector must be aligned with the tunnel velocity. (i.e. turning clockwise when looking down the tunnel)  

# Tools:
-	Each turbine must attach to the shaft in the wind tunnel.   
-	Model your turbine in QBlade  
-	Design your turbine in CAD   
-	To 3D print a part, you must generate the STL file and we (the TAs) will print the piece for you using the printers in the lab.   

## Week 0: April 11-15  
Your objective this week is to experiment with the preprinted turbine and get an idea of what features you would like to see on your turbine.  You will need to learn how to use the setup to construct your power curves. You have also been provided with a CREO & QBlade tutorial, as well as some starter files for you to use. 
## Week 1: April 18-22  
Continue designing and experimenting with the turbine setup. **By the end of your  lab period, you will be need to submit your STL file to your TA for printing so you can have them next week at the latest**.  We will try to have them to you in a few days.  Due to the large number of airfoils and small number of TAs and printers, if you turn your profile in late, you will be bumped to the end of the queue. It will still be printed, but only after the punctual groups and you will have significantly less time to characterize your turbine.
## Week 2: April 25-29  
Continue designing and experimenting with your new baby turbine. **Your second design is due by 10AM the day after your designated lab section**. Again, due to the large number of airfoils and small number of TAs and printers, if you turn your profile in late, you will be bumped to the end of the queue. It will still be printed, but only after the punctual groups and you will have significantly less time to characterize your turbine.
## Week 3: May 2-6  
Characterize your turbines and construct your power curves.  
**Deliverables DUE MAY 10th:** There are two components to the final lab report: an 8 page group report and a 2 page individual abstract and discussion. Each breaks downs as follows.
